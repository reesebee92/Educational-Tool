The purpose of this assignment is to demonstrate the use of polymorphism.

Design

My design includes 3 packages and 1 main method to demonstrate inheritance and the use of packages and interfaces. The first package, Common, includes the required abstract interfaces Drawable, Rotateable, Resizeable, and Sounds with the required methods: drawObject(), rotateObject(), resizeObject(), and playSound() respectively. The second and third packages, Animals and Vehicles, have a hierarchy of classes represented. The Animal and Vehicle class are superclasses while Dog and Toyota are subclasses. These two levels of classes are abstract classes with no real instructions. However, the 2 different objects for both Dog and Toyota (which both implement the Common interface) are called Dachshund, Maltese, Prius, and Camry. These 4 classes include instructions for the methods defined in the Common interface package. Finally, the program Manipulator includes a method to demonstrate the use of packages and interfaces using an array and for loops!
